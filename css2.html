            <h1>Selectors And Specificity</h1>
        </header>
        <h2>Specificity</h2>
        <p>Specificity is the algorithm used by browsers to determine the CSS declaration that is the most relevant to
            an
            element, which in turn, determines the property value to apply to the element.
        </p>
        <h2>Pseudo-class</h2>
        <p>A pseudo-class is used to define a special state of an element.

            For example, it can be used to:

            Style an element when a user mouses over it
            Style visited and unvisited links differently
            Style an element when it gets focus
        </p>

        <h2>pseudo-element</h2>
        <p>A CSS pseudo-element is used to style specified parts of an element.

            For example, it can be used to:
            
            Style the first letter, or line, of an element
            Insert content before, or after, the content of an element</p>

            <h2>Cascading</h2>
            <p>The “cascading” in CSS refers to the fact that styling rules “cascade” down from several sources. This means that CSS has an inherent hierarchy and styles of a higher precedence will overwrite rules of a lower precedence.</p>
            <h2>!important</h2>
            <p>The !important rule in CSS is used to add more importance to a property/value than normal.

                In fact, if you use the !important rule, it will override ALL previous styling rules for that specific property on that element!
                
                Let us look at an example:</p>
